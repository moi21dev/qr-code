## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I've learned how to position a contanier in the center of the viewport.

```css
.card {
    margin: 20vh auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to understand how flexbox works and how to position the items in a more elegant and clean way.

### Useful resources

- [Center position](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48961075) - This helped me for positioning the div in the center of the viewport.
- [favicon in Github Pages](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61073510) - Github pages didn't show the favicon, and this answer was useful to solve the problem.
